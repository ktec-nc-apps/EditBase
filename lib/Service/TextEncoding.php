/**
 * Turning the bytes of a file into UTF-8 text, whatever they were written in.
 *
 * Every way text comes into EditBase goes through here: a document opened from
 * Files, an old version of one, a Markdown file made into a document, a page
 * brought in from the web. Before this each did it its own way, and each got a
 * different case wrong:
 *
 *  - a document from elsewhere was handed on as it was; a Shift_JIS file could
 *    not even be opened, because the bytes were not valid for the JSON carrying
 *    them to the browser;
 *  - a page from the web believed what it said about itself -- and a page that
 *    says Shift_JIS (or ISO-8859-1, which is what a web server says when nobody
 *    told it otherwise) while being written in UTF-8 came out as garbage;
 *  - a Markdown file took ISO-2022-JP for UTF-8 (it is seven-bit, so it is
 *    "valid"), and could take EUC-JP for Shift_JIS (the bytes of the one are
 *    often legal in the other).
 *
 * The rule, in the order it is applied:
 *
 *  1. A byte-order mark says what the file is, and nothing overrules it.
 *  2. ISO-2022-JP switches character sets with escape sequences; if it has them,
 *     it is that. This has to come before UTF-8, which it would otherwise pass.
 *  3. If the bytes are valid UTF-8, the text is UTF-8 -- whatever the file or the
 *     server says about itself. Japanese text written in anything else is almost
 *     never valid UTF-8 by accident, so this is the strongest evidence there is,
 *     and a declaration that contradicts it is the thing that is wrong.
 *  4. Otherwise each candidate is tried, and the one that reads most like text
 *     is taken. Reading EUC-JP as Shift_JIS, or the other way round, gives a
 *     spray of half-width katakana and characters nobody uses; the right reading
 *     gives hiragana and ordinary kanji. What the file declares is only the tie
 *     breaker between readings that are equally good.
 *  5. If nothing reads it, the parts that cannot be read are replaced with
 *     U+FFFD and the caller is told, so the writer can be told.
